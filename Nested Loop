Python Homework Assignment #6: Advanced Loops

Create a function that takes in two parameters: rows, and columns, 
both of which are integers. The function should then proceed to draw a 
playing board (as in the examples from the lectures) the same number of 
rows and columns as specified. After drawing the board, your function should return True.

Try to determine the maximum width and height that your terminal and screen can comfortably 
fit without wrapping. If someone passes a value greater than either maximum, your function 
should return False.
